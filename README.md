# Mini Detector

## Description

The `minidetector` is an app which sniffs network traffic in order to map the network.

`minidetector` is built upon 2 sub-projects:

- [`sniffer`](./minidetector) - Sniffs the packets and inserts MAC, IP address pairs into the database.
- [`api`](./api) - Allows users to fetch the mapped data from the DB using a safe and sound interface.

--------

## Installation

**Dependencies:**

- `Docker`
- `Docker Compose`

In order to run `minidetector` execute the following command:
`$ docker-compose up`

This command will run both services, and the DB container as configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
