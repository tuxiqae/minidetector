# Mini Detector
### A small network assets detector example

The mini detector sniffs network packets (using scapy) and stores all the MAC, IP couples into a table in a PostgreSQL
database.

It was written as a base for job interviews questions, you may use it for inspiration, but you really don't want to use
it in production :)

#### How to install
If you just want to run it:
```python setup.py install```

If you want to develop as well:
```python setup.py develop```

#### Pre-requisites

The project expects to run on a server that runs a `PostgreSQL` server. In addition, the `PostgreSQL` server should have
a db called `minidetector`, owned by a user called `detector`.

In order to set up the database on macOS, run:
```./setup_scripts/initialize_db_macos.sh```

#### How to run
```
